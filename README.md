gizzleU App
===============================

This is an mobile app that was created to engage girls ages 9-13 in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields
using gamification.  The game is similiar to the Jeopardy game concept with the topics being something that young girls are
interested.  Questons will be asked that relate those topics back to the STEM fields.  This way players will be playing a game
based on topics they are interested in while learing about STEM.

How to play:
1. After signing in, select one of the tiles in any order from any of the category.
2. Once the question is displayed, select the correct answer.
3. If answered correctly, the number of points displayed on the tile will be added to the player's score.
4. For this first interation, players are playing to see if they can get the highest score
5. Each time they play, they will attempt to get higher and higher score.
6. A dashboard is available to see how players compare with other players to see who can be gizzled to the max.
